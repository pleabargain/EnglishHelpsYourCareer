We use **comparative [[adjectives]]** to show change or make comparisons:
  

* This phone is certainly **better**, but it's much **more expensive**.

* I'm feeling **healthier** now.

* We need a **bigger** apartment.
  

We use _than_ when we want to **compare one thing with another**:


* She is two years younger **than** me.

* Beijing is much bigger **than** Boston.

* He is a better singer **than** Bono.

* France is a bigger country **than** Bhutan.



When we want to **describe how something or someone changes** we can use two comparatives with _and_:

 
*The party got **bigger and bigger**.

* Everything is getting **more and more expensive**.
* It was more expensive than I expected.

* Grandmother is looking **older and older**._


We often use _the_ with comparative adjectives to **show that one thing depends on another**:

  

* _**The faster** you drive, **the more dangerous** it is._ 

* (= When you drive faster, it is more dangerous.)


* _**The higher** they climbed,_ **the colder** _it got._ 

* (= When they climbed higher, it got colder.)

* He's smarter than he looks.
* I need to work harder than I did before.
* I need to [earn|make] more money than I make now.
