We use **comparative [adjectives](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/adjectives)** to show change or make comparisons:

> _This car is certainly **better**, but it's much **more expensive**.  
> I'm feeling **happier** now.  
> We need a **bigger** garden._

We use _than_ when we want to **compare one thing with another**:

> _She is two years older **than** me.  
> New York is much bigger **than** Boston.  
> He is a better player **than** Ronaldo.  
> France is a bigger country **than** Britain._

When we want to **describe how something or someone changes** we can use two comparatives with _and_:

> _The balloon got **bigger and bigger**.  
> Everything is getting **more and more expensive**.  
> Grandfather is looking **older and older**._ 

We often use [_the_](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/definite-article-the) with comparative adjectives to **show that one thing depends on another**:

> _**The faster** you drive, **the more dangerous** it is._   
> (= When you drive faster, it is more dangerous.)
> 
> _**The higher** they climbed,_ **the colder** _it got._   
> (= When they climbed higher, it got colder.)
