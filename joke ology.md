On his way, he asked the Captain:

Professor: - “Do you know Biology, Ecology, Zoology, Geography, physiology?

The Captain replied no to all his questions.

Professor: What the hell!  You will die of illiteracy!

After a while, the boat was in a storm and it started to sink.

Captiain to the professor: Do you know swiminology & escapology from sharkology?

The professor said no.

Sailor: “Well, that's too bad because sharkology is going to eat your assology!"
