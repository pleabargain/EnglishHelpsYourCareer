# Why
I'm applying to this course it will provide opportunities for me to grow professionally in personally in my chosen field. I'll describe that in further detail below.  I am very keen on learning how to manage finance and business planning. I heard about your program from a trusted colleague and I believe that there is a good combination of work and study to match my professional needs.

# how previous education works for you
My experience in the medical industry is extensive. I started in the pharmaceutical industry as a laboratory assistant and I am now managing clinical multiple study teams across Ukraine. I earned my BS in Biotechnolgy at XXX, and then I completed by MS in Bio-Pharmaceuticals at XXX. I have worked my whole adult life in medicine. I feel that I know many of the important factors of the medical industry but an MBA would help me identify the core principles of medicine as a business.

# how long term 
 
I want to open a Mental Health Clinic in Kyiv. I believe that there is lack of proper business models of Mental Health Centers in Ukraine. As well as there is no methodologically conceptualize Body and Mind oriented treating facilities, which are highly popular and scientifically proven effective for patients with mental health issues. In addition, I am willing to open research department in a clinic. Research department will make possible to find out what are the main factors that influence on the patient treating process and it could help to make treatment process more effective. Furthermore, as I am experienced specialist in the clinical trials, medical facility can take part in some clinical trials.
