    Mom-->son: You shouldn't waste your time!

    son-->Mom: Why?

    Mom-->son: Because time is very important<br> and you can't get it back. 

    son-->Mom: But what if I don't care about wasting time?

    Mom-->son: Right now you don't care about time...<br> but maybe in ten or twenty years you will regret things<br> that you didn't even try because<br> you were wasting your time.

    son-->Mom: Thanks for your advice but I want to be happy right now!

    Mom-->son: I just want you to consider my ideas.

    son-->Mom: Thanks Mom!
