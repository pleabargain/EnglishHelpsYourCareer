# negotiate
## Being able to negotiate is important.

## Remember in negotiating: 

- perform the due diligence required. 
- Consider many options. 
- Consider best case and worst case scenarios. 
- Understand your limits of what you can bargain. 
- Consider conditional responses to counter offers. 
- Understand client goals. 
- Learn as much as you can about who you are negotiating with! 
- The more you learn about your client the better prepared you are.
- Practice negotiating.

-Q:  (agenda) Let's just run through the agenda.  As you can see we have a huge backlog! 

- A:(proposal) Let's include 50 stories into the back log.
 
-Q:  (suggestions) From where we stand, a better solution might be to estimate the stories first!

- A: (agreeing) Yes, let's estimate the stories first!

-Q:  (objecting) Honestly speaking, we don't have enough time to perform the estimates!

- A: (prioritizing) Estimation is very important to understand the scope of work!

-Q:  (clarification) How much time do you think you need to complete the estimation?Can you be specific? 

- A: (compromising) We can include 50 short stories in this sprint but first we need to estimate them.

-Q:  (bargaining) Ok. Let's get one more QA from team 2 to help you! Does that work for you?
- A: (bargaining) One is not enough. If you give me 3 QAs I can complete the 50 user stories on time.

-Q:  (postponing) Letâ€™s break and come back with some fresh ideas because we don't have the resources for this project.

- A: (concluding) Ok, let's take a break and come back in an hour to continue the discussion.

-Q:  (seal_the_deal) Ok!
