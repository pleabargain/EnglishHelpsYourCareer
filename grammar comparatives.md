[[grammar subordinating conjunctions]]
[[grammar superlatives]]

We use **comparative [[grammar adjectives]]** to show change or make comparisons:
  
- The flooding got much worse after the storm.
- It is worse than before.

- Everyone is driving more carefully because of the rain.
- This phone is certainly **better**, but it's much **more expensive**.
- The water is **bluer** here than over there.
- It will be **easier** if you do what I tell you.
- I'm feeling **healthier** now.
- She is moving **closer** to the coast.
- When I was **younger** I used to play with dolls.
- We need a **bigger** apartment.
- She's even **crazier** than me.
---
We use _than_ when we want to **compare one thing with another**:

- She is two years younger **than** me.
- This is easier than that.
- This is harder than that.
- Beijing is much bigger **than** Boston.
- He is a better singer **than** Bono.
- France is a bigger country **than** Bhutan.



When we want to **describe how something or someone changes** we can use two comparatives with _and_:

 
- The party got **bigger and bigger**.

 - Everything is getting **more and more expensive**.
 - It was more expensive than I expected.

- Grandmother is looking **older and older**._


We often use _the_ with comparative adjectives to **show that one thing depends on another**:

  

* _**The faster** you drive, **the more dangerous** it is._ 
* (= When you drive faster, it is more dangerous.)

- This service is more difficult to use than the one that we used before.

* _**The higher** they climbed,_ **the colder** _it got._ 

* (= When they climbed higher, it got colder.)

* He's smarter than he looks.
* I need to work harder than I did before.
* I need to [earn|make] more money than I make now.
