Regarding your proposal, our position is X.
How do you feel about X?
We are interested in getting delivery as soon as possible.
We will give you a X% discount if you buy more than 50 units.
We could consider further discounts on the condition that you place regular orders for the next six months.
I would like to suggest postponing the integration until the next sprint.
May I suggest we move some of the budget from testing over to dev?
We’ll pay for the delivery as long as X is delivered first.
We’ll pay for the delivery provided that we get X.
We’ll pay for the delivery on the condition that X happens.
We’ll pay for the delivery if you agree to pay in advance.
If you pay for the insurance, we will give you a discount.
How about paying 60% on delivery and the rest in 30 days?
How about we structure the team with one architect, one senior dev and five junior devs?
