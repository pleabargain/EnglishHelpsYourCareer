Should I travel by train or by air?
How should I dress?
Can you tell me what I should do?
I’m thinking of leaving…
I can’t make up my mind whether to resign or not...
I’d like to ask your advice.
How do you think can I persuade him to go alone?
Could you give me a bit of advice?
What do you think I should do?
What do you advise me to do?
Do you think I must give up without any argument?
