- doctor: Hi, what’s wrong?  
- patient: I feel unwell and keep vomiting all the time.  
- doctor: How long have you felt like this?  
- patient: Nearly two days. It started just before going to bed the day before yesterday.  
- doctor: Let me examine you. I will press on your stomach to see if it hurts and then listen to your heart.  
- patient: Ok. It doesn’t hurt when you press my stomach. I just feel tired.  
- doctor: Ok. Did you eat anything different from usual before you started to feel this way?  
- patient: Yes my boyfriend cooked dinner for me. He isn’t a very good cook and the food tasked a bit strange.  
- doctor: You’ve got food poisoning. It is not very serious and you should be better in another day.  
- patient: Oh dear, what should I do.  
- doctor: You need to drink lots of water and get plenty of rest.  
- patient: Ok, thank you doctor.  
- doctor: You’re welcome. If you are not better in 48 hours come and see me again.
