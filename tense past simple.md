[[English Tenses]]

---

We make the past simple just like the present simple except we use 'did' instead of 'do / does'. It's really easy because 'did' doesn't change, even with 'he / she / it'. The positive: We usually make the positive by adding '-ed' to the infinitive.

Past simple sentences are created by changing a regular verb into its past tense form, we normally add â€“ED to the end of the verb.
