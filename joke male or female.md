A Spanish Teacher was teaching in a class about the usage of nouns. How, unlike English, Spanish nouns are categorized as masculine or feminine.  

“House” for example, is Feminine: “La Casa.”

“Pencil” , however, is masculine: “El Lapiz.”

A student asked, “What gender is “Computer”?

In spite of giving the answer, the Spanish Teacher decided to do a fun activity which results in a funny computer joke. She made two groups of the class, one male and one female, and asked them to discuss whether the “Computer” is masculine or a feminine noun and come up with four reasons in the support of their recommendation.

The boys took their call that “Computer” should surely be the female( La Computadora”), because:

1.  Only the creator knows their internal logic.
2.  The language used by them is incomprehensible to everyone else.
3.  However small the mistake, it is stored in the long term memory for later use.
4.  Just when you decide to commit to one, you find yourself spending more on the accessories.

The discussion becomes more interesting when it's the girls' turn.

The girls decided that computers must be Male ( "El Computadoro”), because:

1.  If you want to do something with them, initially, you have to turn them on.
2. They have all the data but still can’t think for themselves.
3.  Their job is to solve problems but most of the time they are the problem.
4.  Just when you decide to commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.

The girls won.
