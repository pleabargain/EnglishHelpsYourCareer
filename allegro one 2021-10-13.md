We all know that remodeling can be a hassle. But occasionally a construction project turns into a total disaster and you end up at odds with your contractor -- even though you thoroughly [vetted the contractor](https://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/contracting/five-essential-questions-ask-before-hiring-contractor/) and the [remodeling contract](https://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/contracting/what-remodeling-contract-should-say/) before signing. Shoddy workmanship, unexplained delays, and amenities that never get installed can lead to frustration and anger.

hassle = problem
vetted = thoroughly investigated
shoddy = poorly done

The roads in Kyiv are shoddy!
