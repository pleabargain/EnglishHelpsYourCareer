I hope to see him soon.
I hope you haven’t paid for it.
I hope so.
I think you’ll like our neighborhood.
I only hope he’ll be able to help them out.
I was hoping for good news this time.
I’m rather hoping the weather’ll be good.
I hope we can make them feel welcome.
I hope she’ll do it.
I just hope he’ll be able to come.
We hope to go there next week.
I very much hope they’d realize its importance.
Hopefully, she’ll bring it with him.
Let’s hope she’ll get better soon.
