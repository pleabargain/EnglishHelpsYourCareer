# negotiate
## Being able to negotiate is important.



---
Context: You are negotiating.

        
Tom, from the Egypt office, starts by opening the meeting by saying :

- (agenda) We should begin the meeting. Would you agree? 

- (proposal) I would like to suggest postponing the integration until the next sprint. 
 
- (suggestions) I believe the best option would be … 

- (agreeing) Let's take your idea and improve upon it. 

- (objecting) I can’t make that decision myself. 

- (prioritizing) X is our major priority. 

- (clarification) Could you clarify one point for me? 

- (compromising) We are ready to accept your offer; however, there would be one condition… 

- (bargaining) From where we stand an acceptable price would be X. 

- (postponing) I think we should both seriously reconsider our positions. 

- (concluding) That covers everything, I suppose. 

- (asking_sale) Let's sign the agreement.
