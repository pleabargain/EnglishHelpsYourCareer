 Context: You are negotiating. 


        
        David, from the Canada office, starts by opening the meeting by saying :


        - (agenda) Can we concentrate on X first and then get to Y and Z later? 


        - (proposal) We will give you a X% discount if you buy more than 50 units. 

 
        - (suggestions) What is there in the deal for us? 


        - (agreeing) Let’s stick to your idea. 


        - (objecting) I can’t make that decision myself. 


        - (prioritizing) Our main concern is X. 


        - (clarification) Could you clarify one point for me? 


        - (compromising) I see your point but… 


        - (bargaining) We would be willing to X if Y? 


        - (postponing) Let’s break and come back with some fresh ideas. 


        - (concluding) Let’s summarize the main points. 


        - (asking_sale) Will you accept our offer?
