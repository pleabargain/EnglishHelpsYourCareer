## Being able to negotiate is important.



---
Context: You are negotiating.

        
George, from the Fiji office, starts by opening the meeting by saying :

- (agenda) First we need to agree on the agenda. Can we concentrate on X first and then get to Y and Z later? 

- (proposal) I would like to suggest postponing the integration until the next sprint. 
 
- (suggestions) I believe the best option would be … 

- (agreeing) That sounds reasonable. 

- (objecting) I can’t make that decision myself. 

- (prioritizing) X is a secondary issue. 

- (clarification) I’m not sure I fully understand your point. 

- (compromising) What I may be able to consider is… 

- (bargaining) I’m afraid we can only go as low as X. 

- (postponing) I think we should both seriously reconsider our positions. 

- (concluding) Let’s just confirm the details, then. 

- (asking_sale) Can we agree to this offer?
