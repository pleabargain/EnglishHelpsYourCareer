[[English Tenses]]

---

The future continuous tense, sometimes also referred to as the future progressive tense, is a verb tense that indicates that something will occur in the future and continue for an expected length of time. It is formed **using the construction will + be + the present participle (the root verb + -ing)**.

To form the future continuous with going to, you need to use the correct present form of the verb **to be** (am/is/are). Then use going to be. Then use the -ing form of the verb. am going to be working.
