- Q: Can we take it to a mechanic and have your car looked over?
- A: (proposal) I will give you a 50% discount if you buy it in cash. Pay me cash it's your car!
- Q: It's a bit of a problem as we don't have cash. 
- A: (suggestions) From where I stand, you're not going to find a better deal!
- Q: (agreeing) Letâ€™s stick to your idea. 
- A: Ok, cash!
- Q: I partially agree... let's take your idea improve upon it. From my perspective, if I see someone is ready to give a discount...
