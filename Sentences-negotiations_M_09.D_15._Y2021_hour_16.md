# negotiate
## Being able to negotiate is important.



---
Context: You are negotiating.

        
John, from the Botswana office, starts by opening the meeting by saying :

- (agenda) First we need to agree on the agenda. Can we concentrate on X first and then get to Y and Z later? 

- (proposal) We will give you a X% discount if you buy more than 50 units. 
 
- (suggestions) I was wondering if I could ask you to extend the payment date? 

- (agreeing) If you can do X, I’m on board. 

- (objecting) If you look at it from my point of view… 

- (prioritizing) What are your main priorities? 

- (clarification) Could you clarify one point for me? 

- (compromising) If you look at it from my point of view you will understand that… 

- (bargaining) We would be willing to X if Y? 

- (postponing) Perhaps we should adjourn to reconsider. 

- (concluding) Let’s just confirm the details, then. 

- (asking_sale) Let's get our signatures on this agreement.
