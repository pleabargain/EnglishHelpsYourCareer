<p>We make the Present Continuous tense <strong>by adding -ing to the base verb</strong>. Normally it’s simple: we just add -ing. But sometimes we have to change the word a little. Perhaps we double the last letter, or we drop a letter.</p>

<h2 id="tense-past-simple.md">tense past simple.md</h2>
<p>[[English Tenses]]</p>
<hr />
<p>We make the past simple just like the present simple except we use ‘did’ instead of ‘do / does’. It’s really easy because ‘did’ doesn’t change, even with ‘he / she / it’. The positive: We usually make the positive by adding ‘-ed’ to the infinitive.</p>
<p>Past simple sentences are created by changing a regular verb into its past tense form, we normally add –ED to the end of the verb.</p>

<p>We use <strong>comparative <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/adjectives">adjectives</a></strong> to show change or make comparisons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_This car is certainly <strong>better</strong>, but it’s much <strong>more expensive</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m feeling <strong>happier</strong> now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a <strong>bigger</strong> garden._</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use <em>than</em> when we want to <strong>compare one thing with another</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_She is two years older <strong>than</strong> me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>New York is much bigger <strong>than</strong> Boston.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He is a better player <strong>than</strong> Ronaldo.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>France is a bigger country <strong>than</strong> Britain._</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we want to <strong>describe how something or someone changes</strong> we can use two comparatives with <em>and</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_The balloon got <strong>bigger and bigger</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything is getting <strong>more and more expensive</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Grandfather is looking <strong>older and older</strong>._</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often use <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/definite-article-the"><em>the</em></a> with comparative adjectives to <strong>show that one thing depends on another</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The faster</strong> you drive, <strong>the more dangerous</strong> it is.</em> </p>

<p>Bob: The police don’t want to work on old rape cases.</p>
<p>Ana: Why don’t the police want to work on old rape cases?</p>

<p>Ana: What then is the solution? What does your organization propose?</p>
<p>Bob: The police don’t want to work with old evidence. The crime happened a long time ago. We propose to simplify how the police work with evidence.</p>
<p>Ana: Specifically? Can you tell me more details?</p>
<hr />
<p>Ana: What is your message to the government?</p>
<p>Bob: Women that have been violated should have the right to seek justice. Women that have been violated should have the right to seek reparation from the government.</p>

<p>[[grammar elements subordinating conjunctions]]</p>
<p>[[grammar in use superlatives]]</p>
<p>We use <strong>comparative [[grammar elements adjectives]]</strong> to show change or make comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The flooding got much worse after the storm.</p></li>
<li><p>It is worse than before.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone is driving more carefully because of the rain.</p></li>
<li><p>This phone is certainly <strong>better</strong>, but it’s much <strong>more expensive</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p>We need a <strong>bigger</strong> apartment.</p></li>
<li><p>She’s even <strong>crazier</strong> than me.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>We use <em>than</em> when we want to <strong>compare one thing with another</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>She is two years younger <strong>than</strong> me.</p></li>
<li><p>This is easier than that.</p></li>
<li><p>This is harder than that.</p></li>
<li><p>Beijing is much bigger <strong>than</strong> Boston.</p></li>
<li><p>He is a better singer <strong>than</strong> Bono.</p></li>
<li><p>France is a bigger country <strong>than</strong> Bhutan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When we want to <strong>describe how something or someone changes</strong> we can use two comparatives with <em>and</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The party got <strong>bigger and bigger</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything is getting <strong>more and more expensive</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It was more expensive than I expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Grandmother is looking <strong>older and older</strong>._</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We often use <em>the</em> with comparative adjectives to <strong>show that one thing depends on another</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em><strong>The faster</strong> you drive, <strong>the more dangerous</strong> it is.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(= When you drive faster, it is more dangerous.)</p></li>
<li><p>This service is more difficult to use than the one that we used before.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>The higher</strong> they climbed,</em> <strong>the colder</strong> <em>it got.</em></p></li>
