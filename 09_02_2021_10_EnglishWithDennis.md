We make the past simple just like the present simple except we use 'did' instead of 'do / does'. It's really easy because 'did' doesn't change, even with 'he / she / it'. The positive: We usually make the positive by adding '-ed' to the infinitive.



Past simple sentences are created by changing a regular verb into its past tense form, we normally add –ED to the end of the verb.

The past continuous tense is **formed by combining the past tense of to be** (i.e., was/were) with the verb's present participle (-ing word). There are many situations in which this verb tense might be used in a sentence. For example, it is often used to describe conditions that existed in the past. The past continuous is formed using **was/were + present participle**.

## English in use comparative and superlative adjectives.md

We use **comparative [adjectives](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/adjectives)** to show change or make comparisons:



> _This car is certainly **better**, but it's much **more expensive**.  

> I'm feeling **happier** now.  

> We need a **bigger** garden._



We use _than_ when we want to **compare one thing with another**:



> _She is two years older **than** me.  

> New York is much bigger **than** Boston.  

> He is a better player **than** Ronaldo.  

> France is a bigger country **than** Britain._



When we want to **describe how something or someone changes** we can use two comparatives with _and_:



> _The balloon got **bigger and bigger**.  

> Everything is getting **more and more expensive**.  

> Grandfather is looking **older and older**._ 



We often use [_the_](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/definite-article-the) with comparative adjectives to **show that one thing depends on another**:



> _**The faster** you drive, **the more dangerous** it is._   

> (= When you drive faster, it is more dangerous.)

> 

> _**The higher** they climbed,_ **the colder** _it got._   

> (= When they climbed higher, it got colder.) ---
