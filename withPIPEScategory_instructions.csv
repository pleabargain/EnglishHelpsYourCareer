active or passive voice,"The passive voice in English is a grammatical 'voice'. The noun or noun phrase that would be the object of a corresponding active sentence (such as ""Our troops defeated the enemy"") appears as the subject of a sentence or clause in the passive voice ('The enemy was defeated by our troops.'). The subject of a sentence or clause featuring the passive voice typically denotes the recipient of the action (the patient) rather than the performer (the agent). Verbs in the passive voice in English are formed using several parts (periphrastically): the usual construction uses the auxiliary verbs to be or to get together with the past participle of the main verb.Passive is necessary sometimes.'
adjectives,Words which are used to modify nouns or pronouns are usually referred to as adjectives.
adjectives: comparitives,A Comparative Adjective is a word that describes a noun by comparing it to another noun. Comparative adjectives typically end in 'er' and are followed by the word 'than'.

By incorporating adverbs into your speech and writing, your English skills will become more detailed and interesting. Adverbs are crucial to communicating relevant information in an interesting way."
collocations,"A collocation is two or more words that often go together. These combinations just sound ""right"" to native English speakers, who use them all the time."
conditionals,A conditional sentence is based on the word ‘if’. There are always two parts to a conditional sentence – one part beginning with ‘if’ to describe a possible situation and the second part which describes the consequence.
conditionals: third,We use the third conditional to talk about impossible situations as in the second conditional in the past. We often use the third conditional to describe regrets.
conjunctions,A conjunction is a word like and but although because. Conjunctions have an important function because they join other words and phrases together.
