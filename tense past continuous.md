[[English Tenses]]

---

The past continuous tense is **formed by combining the past tense of to be** (i.e., was/were) with the verb's present participle (-ing word). There are many situations in which this verb tense might be used in a sentence. For example, it is often used to describe conditions that existed in the past. The past continuous is formed using **was/were + present participle**.

Questions are indicated by inverting the subject and was/were. Negatives are made with not.
