I don’t know.
I find it difficult to believe.
I’m not sure.
I’m not certain.
I’m not sure whether he’s telling the truth.
Perhaps…
I doubt if he’ll reach there in time.
That can’t be true.
That means he didn’t actually meet her?
You did hear him say that, didn’t you?
I think he’s the man, but I can’t be certain.
He may call on us on his way there.
Why was that, then?
That seems unlikely, you know.
Surely, you could have explained it to him?
It’s not clear to me why he did such a thing.
Are you absolutely sure he has left?
